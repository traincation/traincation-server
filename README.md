# Traincation server

See [website](https://traincation.schmid.pro/) and [app](https://github.com/traincation/traincation).

## Development

Disclaimer: I did this on my off-time to have fun a learn about Ktor. The code could clearly be better architectured.

```bash
docker-compose up
```

Use the run configurations from IntelliJ.
